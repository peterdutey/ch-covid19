This report is based on `r formatbm(nrow(incidents))` Datix reports of incidents dated up to `r format(max(incidents$incident_date), "%A %e %b %Y")`. Incidents relate to `r formatbm(dplyr::n_distinct(incidents$resident_id))` unique residents. 

Incidents report were obtained from `r formatbm(dplyr::n_distinct(incidents$home_code))` care homes totalling `r formatbm(sum(beds[beds$year=="2020" & beds$home_code %in% unique(incidents$home_code), "beds"]))` beds. In 2020, Four Seasons Health Care comprises `r formatbm(dplyr::n_distinct(beds[beds$year=="2020", "home_code"]))` care homes with a total of `r formatbm(sum(beds[beds$year=="2020", "beds"]))` beds.


## Classification of cases

The incident classification is not wholly consistent, as illustrated in the tabulation below. Due to this, a reclassification algorithm is used.

```{r }
print(ctable(incidents$infection_confirmed, incidents$infection_covid_19_type, useNA = "always"), method = 'render')
```

### Algorithm

The following algorithm is used to classify symptomatic, suspected, and test-confirmed cases from the Datix reports of COVID-19 infections.


```{r echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("../man/figure/case_classification_1.gv", width=700, height= 500)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("../man/figure/case_classification_2.gv", width=700, height= 400)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("../man/figure/case_classification_3.gv", width=400, height= 400)
```


### Validation

Data are tabulated below to evaluate the internal consistency of the rules set out in the previous section.

The `infection_result` field provides information on test results which broadly agrees yet sometimes conflicts with the `infection_confirmed` classification of incidents. It is potentially more up to date although it is very sparsely populated.


```{r}
print(ctable(incidents$infection_covid_19_type, incidents$covid_confirmed, useNA = "always"), method = 'render')
```

```{r}
print(ctable(incidents$infection_covid_19_type, incidents$covid_test_result, useNA = "always"), method = 'render')
```

```{r}
print(ctable(incidents$infection_confirmed, incidents$covid_test_result, useNA = "always"), method = 'render')
```

## Data quality

### Demographic information

Resident pseudoidentifiers were absent in `r sum(grepl("^MISSING", incidents$resident_id))` (`r tbrounding(mean(grepl("^MISSING", incidents$resident_id))*100)`%) of Datix incident reports. The pseudoidentifiers of a further `r sum(!incidents$resident_id[which(!grepl("^MISSING", incidents$resident_id))] %in% unique(residents$resident_id))` reports (`r tbrounding(sum(!incidents$resident_id[which(!grepl("^MISSING", incidents$resident_id))] %in% unique(residents$resident_id))/nrow(incidents)*100)`%) were could not be successfully linked to the residents database. In total, `r sum(is.na(incidents$age) & is.na(incidents$date_of_birth))` reports (`r tbrounding(mean(is.na(incidents$age) & is.na(incidents$date_of_birth))*100)`%) did not have any date of birth or age, and `r sum(is.na(incidents$gender))` reports (`r tbrounding(mean(is.na(incidents$gender))*100)`%) did not have sex recorded. 

### Occupancy

Care home resident days are available from two sources:

- weekly home occupancy reports provided by FSHC
- individual-level resident records of last admission and discharge processing

The plots below compare both measures at the care-home level and FSHC overall.
